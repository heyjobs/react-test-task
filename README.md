# HeyJobs React Assessment Task

Thank you for taking the time to complete this test task! The purpose of the task is to get an idea of your development style: how you tackle a problem, the way you structure your code, your testing strategy, etc.

## Requirements

* Build a React application which:
   * Displays a list of available jobs.
   * Clicking on a job in the list will bring the user to a page which displays all details of the job.
* The app should be server-rendered.
* The app should be responsive.
* You should create and use dummy data for the list of jobs. We suggest the following format:
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Frontend Developer",
    "description": "Comfortable with modern JS stack, experience with React.",
    "employment_type": "full_time"
  }
]
```
* You can tackle this problem as you wish, we use the following stack so it is recommended to do so, but not mandatory!
  * [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
  * [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  * [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

* For testing we use [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
